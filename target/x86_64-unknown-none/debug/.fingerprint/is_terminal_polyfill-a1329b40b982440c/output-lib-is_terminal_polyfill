If using Cargo, add it to `[dependencies]`\n  in Cargo.toml.\n- The crate is present, but under a different name. If using Cargo, look for\n  `package = ` under `[dependencies]` in Cargo.toml.\n\n## Common causes for missing `std` or `core`\n\n- You are cross-compiling for a target which doesn't have `std` prepackaged.\n  Consider one of the following:\n  + Adding a pre-compiled version of std with `rustup target add`\n  + Building std from source with `cargo build -Z build-std`\n  + Using `#![no_std]` at the crate root, so you won't need `std` in the first\n    place.\n- You are developing the compiler itself and haven't built libstd from source.\n  You can usually build it with `x.py build library/std`. More information\n  about x.py is available in the [rustc-dev-guide].\n\n[rustc-dev-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#building-the-compiler\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"C:\\Users\\woisr\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f\\is_terminal_polyfill-1.70.1\\src\\lib.rs","byte_start":1592,"byte_end":1595,"line_start":50,"line_end":50,"column_start":5,"column_end":8,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    std::io::StderrLock<'_>","highlight_start":5,"highlight_end":8}],"label":"can't find crate","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"the `x86_64-unknown-none` target may not support the standard library","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"consider building the standard library from source with `cargo build -Zbuild-std`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0463]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;15m: can't find crate for `std`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;14m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0mC:\\Users\\woisr\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f\\is_terminal_polyfill-1.70.1\\src\\lib.rs:50:5\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;14m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;14m50\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;14m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    std::io::StderrLock<'_>\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;14m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mcan't find crate\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;14m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;14m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;15mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: the `x86_64-unknown-none` target may not support the standard library\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;14m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;15mhelp\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: consider building the standard library from source with `cargo build -Zbuild-std`\u001b[0m\n\n"}
